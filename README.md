Case ventilation Mount for my CTC printer

This uses a filter for a air filter system (http://amzn.to/2rXtFwf) and an 80mm fan to mount to a 40mm fan hole in the top case of my printers enclosure to pull out the air from the printer and filter airosol particulates that form during the printing process.

The Mount Braket is optional and mostly to prevent cracking in the acrylic sheet of the case. But it can be replaced with a 40mm air filter (http://amzn.to/2qZexkv) to filter bigger particles before entering the real filter thus preventing it from clogging too fast.
