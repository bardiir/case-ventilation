Case ventilation Mount for my CTC printer

This uses a filter for a air filter system (http://amzn.to/2rXtFwf) and an 80mm fan to mount to a 40mm fan hole in the top case of my printers enclosure to pull out the air from the printer and filter airosol particulates that form during the printing process.
